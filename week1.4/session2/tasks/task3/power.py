# Week 4, Session 2: Task 4

# Given an incomplete recursive function power to calculate x raised to
# the power of n, your task is to complete the function.


def power(x, n):
    # complete your code here
    # base case
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    # recursive case
    return x*power(x,n-1)

# Once completed, make at least two function calls to test the power function
print(power(6,2))
